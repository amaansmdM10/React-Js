React-Apps
React developers are able to create large web applications which use data that can change over time, without reloading the page. Its main goal is to be fast, simple and scalable. React processes only user interface in applications

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
